# Data Science üöÄ

> "Exploring the things makes me happy, hehee."

This repository was previously named **`ml_algorithms`**, but I renamed it to **`data_science`** to reflect a broader scope of exploration ‚Äî covering not only machine learning algorithms, but also feature engineering, model evaluation, data preprocessing, and more.

I renamed the GitHub repository via the website and updated my local clone to sync with the new name.

# Update the remote URL to the new GitHub repository name
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-username>/data_science.git
